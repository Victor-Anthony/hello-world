# First repo

The code above is a Python script for a language translator program using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. It allows users to input a text and select a target language from a dropdown menu, and then translates the text using the Google Translate API through the googletrans module. The translated output is displayed in a text box on the GUI. The code also creates a virtual display using Xvfb to allow the program to run on headless systems. The program's interface is designed to be user-friendly, with colorful background, labels, and buttons.

#**Requirements.**
Python 3
tkinter module
googletrans module
Xvfb

#**Installation.**
Install Python 3 on your system.
Install tkinter and googletrans modules using pip command pip install tkinter googletrans.
Install Xvfb on your system using the following command !apt-get install -y xvfb.


You need to install Python 3 on your system to run the code. Additionally, you need to install the tkinter and googletrans modules using pip command 'pip install tkinter googletrans'. Finally, you need to install Xvfb on your system using the command '!apt-get install -y xvfb' to create a virtual display with a specific size and color depth. The virtual display is needed for the code to work properly and display the GUI created by tkinter.

#**Usage.**
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Run the script using the command python language_translator.py.
Type the text you want to translate in the "Enter Text" field.
Choose the language you want to translate the text to from the dropdown list.
Click the "Translate" button to get the translated text in the "Output" field.
